Description
-----------
The ``gpu_tracker`` package provides a ``Tracker`` class that tracks (profiles) the usage of compute time, maximum RAM, and maximum GPU RAM.
The compute time is a measurement of the real time taken by the task as opposed to the CPU-utilization time.
The GPU tracking is for Nvidia GPUs and uses the ``nvidia-smi`` command, assuming the Nvidia drivers have been installed.
Computational resources are tracked throughout the duration of a context manager or the duration of explicit calls to the ``start()`` and ``stop()`` methods of the ``Tracker`` class.
The ``gpu-tracker`` command-line interface alternatively tracks the computational-resource-usage of an arbitrary shell command.
